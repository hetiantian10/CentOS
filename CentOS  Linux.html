						<p>CentOS is a Linux distribution that provides a free and open-source community-supported computing platform, functionally compatible with its upstream source, Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<p>The CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproducible platform derived from the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">CentOS Linux Features</h2>
						<p>CentOS is widely used among developers and system administrators as it offers full control over its highly customizable open-source software packages. It is stable and has a large and active support community behind it. Due to its reliability, it has become a popular choice among operating systems for servers.</p>
						<p><li>User Friendly Desktop Environment </li></p>
						<p><li>Networking - nftables replaces iptables, iptablesip6table, arptables, and ebtables, serving as a single framework for IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. In addition, the firewalld deamon will also use the same subsystem for filtering network transactions as its default backend. </li></p>
      <p><li>Cockpit Web Console - Cockpit is highly integrated. Not only does it have an embedded terminal allowing you to switch from terminal to browser at any time, but it also works on mobile devices.</li> </p>
  <p><li>Content Distribution - BaseOS Repository and AppStream Repository</li> </p>
   <p><li>Software Management - Integrated with DNF technology, the latest release has a much-improved software management system. It’s increased performance, has well-defined APIs, and support for modular content, software AppStreams for cloud, container workloads, and CI/CD.</li> </p>

						  <h2 class="section-heading"> &nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp Why Should I Use CentOS Linux?</h2>
						<p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp CentOS uses a very stable (and oftentimes more mature) version of its software and because the release cycle is longer, applications do not need to be updated as often. This allows for developers and major corporations who utilize it to save money as it decreases costs associated with additional development time.</p>

                      <p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp Standard OS </li></p>
                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp With a standard OS underlying your workloads, you can easily move them across environments—where it makes sense for your business. Red Hat Enterprise Linux gives you a consistent, stable foundation across hybrid cloud deployments, along with built-in manageability and integration with the broader Red Hat management and automation portfolio.</p>
                             <p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp Security </li></p>
                          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp
                            SELinux is an access control mechanism that can enforce rules on processes and files, based on policies that you define. One of the most beneficial features is that it reduces vulnerabilities on privilege escalation attacks; If a process is compromised, the attacker would only have access to the normal functions of the process, and only the files that process has been configured to have access to. Because CentOS is more secure out of the box, it is preferred as the starting point as less initial configuration is needed from the start. CentOS regularly pulls backports (or updates) directly from RedHat and pushes those nightly updates out quickly.</p>
                               <p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp
                                   Package Management - CentOS uses the YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified) package manager to keep the system up to date.</p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp <li> A Wealth of Documentation</li></p>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp Because CentOS is a widely used platform throughout the web hosting world, it has become the de facto industry standard. Another of the benefits of its wide use is the amount of information and documentation available for it.</p>
                             
                 <p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp Management Panel Support </li></p>
                     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp
                        CentOS can support multiple management platforms including cPanel, InterWorx, WebMin, DirectAdmin, Spacewalk, CWP, Plesk, ISPConfig, Virtualmin, Vesta CP, and multiple other platforms. These management panels make it easy to host multiple sites on the server as well as keeping all the core processes and server procedures easily managed.</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Which Image Should I Download?</h2>
						<p>Before starting installing CentOS, you must download an installation ISO image. Images are available from the CentOS website.</p>

   <p><b> Installer </b></p>
     
<p><li> <b>DVD ISO</li></b></p>
<p>
This image contains the installer as well as a set of all packages that can be installed during an interactive installation. This is the recommended download for most users.
 </p>
<p><li><b>Everything ISO</li></b> </p>
<p>Contains the installer and all packages available for CentOS. This ISO image can be used to install the system with extra packages (using a Kickstart file and specifying extra packages in the %packages section); it can also be used to set up a local mirror for downloading packages. Note that this image is very large and requires an at least 16 GB flash drive or other storage. </p>
<p><li><b>Minimal ISO</li></b></p>
<p> Contains the installer and a minimal set of packages which can be used to install a very basic CentOS system. You can then use Yum to download additional packages from update repositories.</p>

<p>The images listed on the page linked above are for the AMD64/Intel 64 (x86_64) architecture, which is the CentOS basic distribution. Images for additional architectures such as 64-bit ARM (aarch64) or IBM Power Systems (ppc64), as well as cloud and container images, network install media (only the installer, requires a local package mirror) and live images, are available for download from the CentOS Wiki download page.</p>

<p>Similar tools are available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. You can also use the installation program to verify the media when starting the installation.

						<p>CentOS Does not come with two versions as desktop and server Like Ubuntu (Ubuntu has two versions, Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop), Only Duration the installation user can decide whether wants to install the desktop or Not. And It is quite normal to install a CentOS Server with a Desktop.</p>

<p>CentOS is shipped with the default desktop environment GNOME .</p>

<p>GNOME is the most popular environment in the latest distributions of Linux.</p>

In reality, the command line is immensely powerful and actually allows an experienced user to monitor, control and tune every single aspect of the system.

Even a minimal installation of CentOS comes with a rich selection of useful tools and many others can be installed from the standard repositories.</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">VIM</h2>
						<P>The command line is all about editing text files and there is no better tool than Vim for this purpose.

Vim is actually a very old program that can be traced back to the original vi developed for Unix systems in 1976. It preserves some archaic features but has been constantly improved over the years and can be personalized with many plugins and options.

The initial learning curve is notoriously steep and most Linux newbies have been trapped in Vim at the start of their journey, with no clue how to get out.

However, Vim can be incredibly useful once you learn some of its shortcuts and becomes much more than a simple text editor. You can configure it for example as a very fast coding tool.</P>
<section class="docs-section" id="item-4-2">
<h3 class="section-heading">TOP</h3>
						<P>Just type top in the terminal and you’ll see a dynamic list of all active processes and threads that can be ordered based on various values, such as the CPU or memory usage.

It is a great troubleshooting tool on servers that experience heavy load and allows processes to be killed directly from its interface.</P>

						<h4> YUM </h4>
						<p>In all distributions from the RedHat family, yum serves as the package manager of choice. It is a powerful tool that handles the installation of new packages, as well as their update or removal.

Yum is available by default on all CentOS systems but the software selection in the initial repositories is quite poor. This reflects the RedHat philosophy of emphasizing security and stability, by only offering packages that have been thoroughly tested.

As a result, the official repos provide older software, several versions behind the latest one, for example php 5.4

System administrators usually configure other repositories in order to install and update newer packages.

One of the most popular is epel-release, which can be installed as a package and includes many useful tools. Other common choices are the remi or ius repositories for php and its associated extensions.

Most software developers also maintain dedicated repositories that provide the latest versions of their packages.</p>
<section class="docs-section" id="item-4-4">
						<h5>NETSTAT</h5>
						<p>Netstat is very useful command line tool that shows network connections and statistics, as well as open ports and sockets.

Executing it with no arguments will display a lot of information, so you will have to learn how to control the output using flags.

System administrators typically use nestat to view the processes that listen on certain ports, here is an example of the flags used for this purpose and the result: nestat - tulpn</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Installations Failures</h2>
					<p>If the installation fails, the messages from these files are consolidated into /tmp/anaconda-tb-identifier, where identifier is a random string.

After successful installation, by default, these files will be copied to the installed system under the directory /var/log/anaconda/. However, if installation is unsuccessful, or if the inst.nosave=all or inst.nosave=logs options are used when booting the installation system, these logs will only exist in the installation program’s RAM disk. This means they are not saved permanently and will be lost once the system is powered down. To store them permanently, copy those files to another system on the network by using scp on the system running the installation program, or copy them to a mounted storage device (such as an USB flash drive).  </p> 
<p>Systems with some video cards have trouble booting into the graphical installation program. If the installation program does not run using its default settings, it attempts to run in a lower resolution mode. If that still fails, the installation program attempts to run in text mode.

There are several possible solutions to display issues, most of which involve specifying custom boot options.</p>

						<p>
The CentOS Project is a community-driven free software effort focused around the goal of providing a rich base platform for open source communities to build upon. We will provide a development framework for cloud providers, the hosting community, and scientific data processing, as a few examples.</p>
<p>CentOS is very secure and stable. It is on par with RHEL and receives a lot of the same corporate level security updates making it a great choice for all users. Another strength of CentOS would be its longer release cycle and longer support cycle.</p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Section Item 7.1 <small>(FAQ Category One)</small></h2>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle mr-1"></i>What is CentOS Linux?</h5>
						<p>CentOS Linux provides a free and open source computing platform to anyone who wishes to use it. CentOS Linux releases are built from publicly available open source source code provided by Red Hat, Inc for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
						<p>CentOS conforms fully with Red Hat, Inc's redistribution policies and aims to be functionally compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. CentOS mainly changes packages to remove trademarked vendor branding and artwork.</p>

<p>CentOS Linux does not contain Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Fedora Linux; nor does it have any of their certifications, although it is built from the same source code as the Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>
<section class="docs-section" id="item-7-2">
<h2 class="section-heading">Section Item 7.2 <small>(FAQ Category One)</small></h2>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle mr-1"></i>Many RPMs still contain the name redhat, rhel, or rh. Shouldn't these be changed?</h5>
						<p>The upstream vendor is using open source (mostly GPL) software in their business model. They take software that other people write (Gnome.org, X.org, KDE.org, OpenOffice.org to name a few). They repackage the source files into RPM format for redistribution. Because they chose an open source model to obtain the software they distribute, they must provide their source code to others. That is how the GPL works. The upstream vendor provides much added value by creating the Source RPMS and distributing them. They also fix problems in software and provide feedback to the software developers ... this is what makes open source software work.  </p>

						<h2 class="section-heading">Section Item 7.3 <small>(FAQ Category One)</small></h2>
						<h5 class="pt-3"><i class="fas fa-question-circle mr-1"></i>What is CentOS Stream?</h5>
						<p>CentOS Stream is a developer-forward distribution that aims to help community members, Red Hat partners and others take full advantage of open source innovation within a more stable and predictable Linux ecosystem. Its content is what Red Hat intends to be in the next update of a stable RHEL release. It is free for anyone to download, use, study, modify, and redistribute (with the exception of the CentOS trademarks, which are owned by Red Hat). CentOS Stream is a distribution that community members can use to take advantage of a stable ABI/API for development and testing, while still seeing some updates on an accelerated basis.</p>
